## Code Coverage Breakdown by Method

### Core Execution Flow
- ✅ `execute()` - Main entry point
- ✅ `_execute_levels()` - Level-based execution
- ✅ `_process_level_results()` - Result processing
- ✅ `_cleanup_execution()` - Cleanup and task cancellation

### Node Execution
- ✅ `_execute_node_with_error_handling()` - Error handling wrapper
- ✅ `_get_node_inputs()` - Input gathering from links and results

### Task Management
- ✅ `_cancel_all_tasks()` - Task cancellation

### Stop/Cancellation
- ✅ `force_stop()` - Force stop execution
- ✅ `stop()` - Async stop method

### State Management
- ✅ `state` property
- ✅ `is_running` property
- ✅ `is_stopping` property
- ✅ `is_stopped` property
- ✅ `cancellation_reason` property
- ✅ `_should_stop()` - Stop condition check

### Configuration
- ✅ `set_progress_callback()` - Progress callback setup

### Graph Building
- ✅ `__init__()` - Constructor
- ✅ `_build_graph()` - Graph construction from serialized data

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **Input Handling**
   - Missing inputs
   - Mismatched input/output slots
   - Input slot out of range
   - Results absent for predecessor nodes

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - NodeExecutionError
   - Generic exceptions in nodes
   - CancelledError handling
   - Runtime errors in nodes

3. **Graph Structure**
   - Empty graphs
   - Cycles (detected and rejected)
   - Unknown node types
   - Standalone nodes (skipped)
   - Missing graph keys

4. **Concurrency**
   - Multiple concurrent executions
   - Task cancellation during execution
   - Stop during active execution

5. **State Transitions**
   - IDLE → RUNNING → STOPPED
   - State property access

## Potential Gaps Not Covered

### Minor Gaps (Low Priority)
1. **Logger Usage**: The logger.error() calls are triggered but not explicitly verified with mocks
2. **Vault Usage**: The `self.vault` attribute is instantiated but never used in the tests
3. **Exception Handling in execute()**: The try-except block in `execute()` (lines 86-89) handles exceptions from `_execute_levels()` but we don't explicitly test this path
4. **NodeExecutionError without original_exc**: Edge case where NodeExecutionError doesn't have `original_exc` attribute

### Testing Limitations
- Coverage tool fails due to scipy import issue when loading node registry
- Tests use mock nodes to avoid loading the full node registry
- Some tests may not exercise all branches due to execution timing

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Count**: 37 tests
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (37/37)
- **Test Categories**: 8 distinct categories
- **Mock Nodes**: 8 different mock node types
- **Test Fixtures**: 7 reusable fixtures

## Recommendations

1. **Consider Adding**:
   - Mock-based verification of logger calls
   - Explicit test for exception in `_execute_levels()` propagating to `execute()`
   - Test for NodeExecutionError without `original_exc` attribute

2. **Already Well Covered**:
   - Core execution flow
   - Error handling
   - State management
   - Stop/cancellation
   - Edge cases

3. **Test Organization**:
   - Well-structured with clear test classes
   - Good use of fixtures
   - Comprehensive mock nodes for different scenarios

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the `GraphExecutor` class, including:
- All public methods
- All state management properties
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Concurrency scenarios

The remaining gaps are minor and don't affect the core functionality coverage.
