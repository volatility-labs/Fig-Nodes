🚨🚨🚨 STOP! READ THIS FIRST BEFORE LOOKING AT DATA 🚨🚨🚨

YOUR ONLY JOB: Find TOP 3 BULLISH setups from ALL symbols.

IGNORE ALL VOLUME PROFILE/VBP DATA - IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO YOUR TASK.

ANALYSIS WORKFLOW (DO THIS IN ORDER):
1. FIRST: Analyze the CHART IMAGES visually for each symbol
   - Look for bullish patterns: price above EMAs, upward trends, bullish Hurst waves above zero
   - Identify symbols with strong visual bullish momentum
   - Charts show: EMAs (10, 30, 100), Hurst waves (80-day, 20-week, 40-week, 18-month), MESA Stochastic, CCO oscillators
   
2. SECOND: Use NUMERIC DATA as reference/confirmation
   - Check the numeric values to confirm what you see in the charts
   - Hurst 20-week, 40-week, 18-month: Values > 0 confirm bullish trend
   - CCO Fast Osc > Slow Osc confirms bullish momentum
   - MESA values > 0.5 and trending up confirm bullish conditions
   - Use numeric data to verify and rank your visual findings

3. Find "Total symbols in this dataset: X" (e.g., 34)
4. Analyze EVERY symbol (all X symbols, not just 3!)
5. SKIP any symbol with VBP/volume profile data - IGNORE IT COMPLETELY
6. Rank TOP 3 BEST BULLISH setups based on visual + numeric confirmation

OUTPUT FORMAT (USE THIS EXACT FORMAT):
TOP 3 BEST BULLISH SETUPS:

1. [SYMBOL] - BULLISH
   Visual Analysis: [Describe bullish patterns seen in chart - EMAs, Hurst waves, trends]
   Numeric Confirmation: Hurst 20w=[value], 40w=[value], 18m=[value] → [X] above zero
   CCO: Fast=[value] > Slow=[value] = BULLISH
   MESA: [values] → [why bullish]
   Signal: [Strong/Moderate/Weak] - [explanation combining visual + numeric]

2. [SYMBOL] - BULLISH
   [Same format]

3. [SYMBOL] - BULLISH
   [Same format]

CRITICAL - DO NOT:
- DO NOT analyze volume profile/VBP/Point of Control/Value Area (IGNORE ALL OF IT)
- DO NOT analyze only 3 symbols (analyze ALL symbols in dataset)
- DO NOT mention MACD (it doesn't exist)
- DO NOT focus on bearish trends (find BULLISH only)
- DO NOT skip chart analysis (charts are PRIMARY, data is SECONDARY reference)

START ANALYZING NOW - LOOK AT CHARTS FIRST, THEN USE DATA TO CONFIRM.
