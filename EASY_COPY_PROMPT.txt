Please analyze the provided cryptocurrency chart images which include the most recent volume, EMAs, Hurst data, MESA stochastics, Cycle Channel Oscillator (CCO), and Volume-by-Price (VBP) bars. Also included is longer-term Hurst, MESA, CCO, and OHLCV data.

CRITICAL: All indicators carry EQUAL WEIGHT - Do not prioritize one indicator over others. Look for symbols where multiple indicators align positively.

EMA RELATIONSHIP VERIFICATION (Use Numeric Values for Accuracy):

- Always check the RIGHT SIDE of each chart (most recent data)

- Verify EMA relationships using the NUMERIC VALUES shown in annotations (e.g., "EMA 10: $X.XX", "EMA 30: $X.XX", "EMA 100: $X.XX")

- A "butterfly pattern" requires ALL THREE: EMA 10 value > EMA 30 value > EMA 100 value

- Do NOT assume EMAs are above the 100 EMA just because price is rising - verify by comparing numeric annotation values

- Note: EMAs can still be bullish even if below 100 EMA if other indicators align positively

RANKING CRITERIA (Equal Weight - All Indicators Matter):

1. EMA Analysis (Equal Weight):
   - EMA progression stages (all are positive signals):
     * Convergence: Shorter-term EMAs (10, 30) coming together
     * Recent Crosses: Recent crosses of shorter-term EMAs over longer-term EMAs (e.g., EMA 10 crossing above EMA 30, EMA 30 crossing above EMA 100) - THIS IS PARTICULARLY POSITIVE
     * Butterfly: EMAs "butterflying" above 100 EMA (EMA 10 > EMA 30 > EMA 100)
     * Spread/Expansion: Butterfly pattern expanding (early stages preferred, not over-extended)
   - Look for symbols in any of these stages, with recent crosses being particularly positive
   - Verify using numeric values from annotations

2. Price Action (Equal Weight):
   - Recent upward movement and momentum strength
   - Price pattern formations
   - Current price relative to EMAs

3. Volume Analysis (Equal Weight):
   - Volume trends and spikes
   - Volume supporting price movement
   - Volume relative to recent averages

4. Hurst Analysis (Equal Weight):
   - Composite oscillator direction and strength
   - Period-specific signals (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 day)
   - Oscillator position relative to zero
   - Multiple period alignments

5. MESA Stochastic (Equal Weight):
   - Multi-length indicator positions (MESA1, MESA2, MESA3, MESA4)
   - Trigger line relationships
   - Momentum direction and strength
   - Stochastic position and trend

6. Cycle Channel Oscillator - CCO (Equal Weight):
   - Fast Oscillator: Price position within medium-term channel (0.0 to 1.0 range)
   - Slow Oscillator: Short cycle midline position within medium-term channel (0.0 to 1.0 range)
   - Oscillator relationships: Fast Osc ABOVE Slow Osc = BULLISH (positive momentum), Fast Osc BELOW Slow Osc = BEARISH (negative momentum)
   - Both oscillators trending upward = bullish, both trending downward = bearish
   - Extreme conditions: Values above 1.0 (overbought) or below 0.0 (oversold) - highlighted in purple
   - Position relative to key levels (0.0, 0.5, 1.0)
   - Note: Similar to %b oscillator - Fast Osc shows price location, Slow Osc acts as signal line

7. Volume-by-Price (VBP) Analysis (Equal Weight):
   - VBP bars appear as horizontal bars on the LEFT SIDE of the price chart, extending into the chart area
   - BIG BARS = Important Support/Resistance Levels: Thick, wide VBP bars indicate price levels where significant volume was traded
     * These act as STRONG support (if price is above) or STRONG resistance (if price is below)
     * Price tends to pause, bounce, or reverse at these high-volume price zones
     * Multiple big bars clustered together create even stronger support/resistance zones
   - NARROW BARS or NO BARS = Free Flow Lanes: Thin or missing VBP bars indicate price levels with little trading activity
     * These are "free flow lanes" where price can move easily with minimal resistance
     * Price tends to move quickly through these low-volume zones
     * Gaps between VBP bars indicate price levels with minimal historical trading activity
   - Current Price Position: Analyze where current price is relative to VBP bars
     * Price ABOVE big VBP bars = Strong support below, potential for upward movement
     * Price BELOW big VBP bars = Strong resistance above, potential for downward pressure
     * Price IN low-volume zone = Easy movement potential in either direction
     * Price approaching big VBP bar = Likely to encounter support/resistance
   - VBP Distribution: Look for patterns in VBP bar distribution
     * Clustered big bars = Strong support/resistance zones
     * Scattered or missing bars = Volatile price zones with less predictable behavior
     * Even distribution = More balanced trading activity across price range

8. Overall Momentum & Convergence (Equal Weight):
   - Multiple indicators aligning in same direction
   - Early-stage patterns (not over-extended)
   - Strong confirmation across all indicators
   - Note any divergences or conflicts between indicators
