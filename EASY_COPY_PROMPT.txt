Please analyze ALL chart images provided. Each chart shows a different symbol with the most recent volume, EMAs, Hurst data, MESA stochastics, Cycle Channel Oscillator (CCO), and Volume-by-Price (VBP) bars. Also included is longer-term Hurst, MESA, CCO, and OHLCV data.

CRITICAL: Analyze ALL symbols present in the provided charts/images. After analyzing all symbols, select and report ONLY the TOP 3 BEST BULLISH (LONG) setups for short-term trading.

CRITICAL: Look ONLY for BULLISH (LONG) setups. Focus on signals indicating upward price movement. Rank the top 3 best bullish opportunities based on signal strength.

CRITICAL: Focus on VERY SHORT-TERM signals (next few hours to 1-2 days maximum). Prioritize immediate momentum, recent crosses, and current price action over longer-term patterns.

CRITICAL: Use THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS to determine bullish/bearish setup:
1. Hurst Spectral Analysis Oscillator (Composite) - PRIMARY INDICATOR
2. MESA Stochastic Multi Length - PRIMARY INDICATOR  
3. Cycle Channel Oscillator (CCO) - PRIMARY INDICATOR

These three indicators are REQUIRED and carry PRIMARY WEIGHT in determining if a symbol is bullish or bearish.

SECONDARY INDICATORS (use at discretion only for confirmation):
- EMAs (Moving Averages) - Use only to confirm or provide additional context
- Volume - Use only to confirm momentum or divergence
- Volume-by-Price (VBP) - Use only to identify support/resistance levels

Prioritize symbols where the THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS align positively for BULLISH movement. Secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) should only be used to confirm or provide additional context, not as primary determinants.

CRITICAL: After analyzing ALL symbols, select ONLY symbols that show STRONG BULLISH signals. Rank the TOP 3 BEST BULLISH setups, but ONLY include symbols that are actually bullish. If fewer than 3 symbols show strong bullish signals, only rank those that are bullish. DO NOT include bearish or neutral symbols just to fill the top 3. If there are fewer than 3 bullish symbols, provide analysis for only those bullish symbols (e.g., if only 1 symbol is bullish, provide analysis for just that 1 symbol).

EMA RELATIONSHIP VERIFICATION (Use Numeric Values for Accuracy - SHORT-TERM FOCUS):

- Always check the RIGHT SIDE of each chart (most recent data) - THIS IS CRITICAL FOR SHORT-TERM SIGNALS

- Verify EMA relationships using the NUMERIC VALUES shown in annotations (e.g., "EMA 10: $X.XX", "EMA 30: $X.XX", "EMA 100: $X.XX")

- PRIORITIZE RECENT CROSSES: Recent crosses (EMA 10↑30, EMA 30↑100, EMA 10↑100) in the last few bars are STRONGEST signals for immediate movement

- A "butterfly pattern" requires ALL THREE: EMA 10 value > EMA 30 value > EMA 100 value (but recent crosses are MORE IMPORTANT for short-term)

- Do NOT assume EMAs are above the 100 EMA just because price is rising - verify by comparing numeric annotation values

- For short-term: EMA convergence and recent crosses are MORE VALUABLE than butterfly patterns (which take time to develop)

RANKING CRITERIA (Primary Indicators First, Secondary at Discretion):

PRIMARY INDICATORS (Required - Use These to Determine Bullish/Bearish):

1. Hurst Spectral Analysis Oscillator (PRIMARY):
   - PRIORITIZE IMMEDIATE SIGNALS (in order of importance for next few hours):
     * **RECENT CROSSES** (HIGHEST PRIORITY): Recent crosses in last 1-5 bars are STRONGEST short-term signals
       - EMA 10 crossing above EMA 30 = Immediate bullish momentum
       - EMA 30 crossing above EMA 100 = Strong bullish confirmation
       - EMA 10 crossing above EMA 100 = Very strong bullish signal
     * **Convergence**: Shorter-term EMAs (10, 30) coming together = Potential for immediate breakout
     * **Current Price vs EMAs**: Price above all EMAs = Bullish, Price below all EMAs = Bearish (for next few hours)
   - Multiple short-period alignments (5, 10, 20 day) = Stronger signal than long-period alignments
   - Assessment: Above zero = Bullish momentum, Below zero = Bearish momentum

2. MESA Stochastic Multi Length (PRIMARY):
   - CHECK RIGHT SIDE OF CHART (most recent bars) - this is what matters for next few hours
   - Multi-length indicator positions (MESA1, MESA2, MESA3, MESA4) - each with its own trigger line (dashed)
   - MESA Stochastic values range from 0.0 to 1.0 (similar to standard stochastic oscillator)
   - **IMMEDIATE CROSSOVER SIGNALS (Bullish - HIGHEST PRIORITY - FOCUS ON THESE):**
     * Crossover in TOP HALF (above 0.5) = "PUMP" signal - STRONG BULLISH momentum for NEXT FEW HOURS
     * When MESA lines cross ABOVE their trigger lines in the upper half RIGHT NOW = Immediate buy signal
     * Recent crossovers (last 1-3 bars) are STRONGEST signals
   - **AVOID BEARISH SIGNALS (Do not select symbols with these):**
     * Crossunder in BOTTOM HALF (below 0.5) = "DUMP" signal - STRONG BEARISH momentum

   - Assessment: Bullish crossovers in top half = Strong bullish, Bearish crossunders in bottom half = Strong bearish

3. Cycle Channel Oscillator - CCO (PRIMARY):
   - CHECK RIGHT SIDE OF CHART (current values) - this determines next few hours direction
   - Fast Oscillator: Price position within medium-term channel (0.0 to 1.0 range) - CURRENT value matters most
   - Slow Oscillator: Short cycle midline position within medium-term channel (0.0 to 1.0 range) - CURRENT value matters most
   - **IMMEDIATE RELATIONSHIP (RIGHT NOW):**
     * Fast Osc ABOVE Slow Osc RIGHT NOW = BULLISH momentum for next few hours

     * Near 0.5 = Neutral (watch for direction change)
     * Near 1.0 = Overbought (potential pullback soon)
   - Note: Similar to %b oscillator - Fast Osc shows price location, Slow Osc acts as signal line
   - Assessment: Fast Osc > Slow Osc = Bullish, Fast Osc < Slow Osc = Bearish

SECONDARY INDICATORS (Use at Discretion Only - For Confirmation):

4. EMA Analysis (Secondary - Use at Discretion):
   - PRIORITIZE IMMEDIATE SIGNALS (in order of importance for next few hours):
     * **RECENT CROSSES** (HIGHEST PRIORITY): Recent crosses in last 1-5 bars are STRONGEST short-term signals
       - EMA 10 crossing above EMA 30 = Immediate bullish momentum
       - EMA 30 crossing above EMA 100 = Strong bullish confirmation
       - EMA 10 crossing above EMA 100 = Very strong bullish signal
     * **Convergence**: Shorter-term EMAs (10, 30) coming together = Potential for immediate breakout
     * **Current Price vs EMAs**: Price above all EMAs = Bullish, Price below all EMAs = Bearish (for next few hours)
   - Lower priority for short-term: Butterfly patterns take time to develop (less relevant for hours/days timeframe)
   - Verify using numeric values from annotations - focus on RIGHT SIDE of chart (most recent)
   - Use EMAs only to confirm direction suggested by primary indicators, not as primary determinant

5. Price Action (Secondary - Use at Discretion):
   - IMMEDIATE MOMENTUM: Last 3-10 bars showing strong directional movement (most important)
   - Current price relative to EMAs (right side of chart) - above/below for immediate direction
   - Recent price patterns: Breakouts, reversals, or consolidations in last few bars
   - Volume confirmation: Is volume supporting the recent price movement? (critical for short-term)
   - Ignore longer-term patterns - focus on what's happening NOW
   - Use price action only to confirm momentum suggested by primary indicators

6. Volume Analysis (Secondary - Use at Discretion):
   - RECENT VOLUME SPIKES: Volume spikes in last 1-5 bars = Strong immediate signal
   - Volume supporting CURRENT price movement (right side of chart) = Confirmation for next few hours
   - Volume relative to recent averages (last 20 bars) - above average = stronger signal
   - Volume divergence: Decreasing volume on price moves = weakening momentum (bearish for continuation)
   - Current volume vs price: High volume + price up = Strong buy signal, High volume + price down = Strong sell signal
   - Use volume only to confirm momentum suggested by primary indicators

7. Volume-by-Price (VBP) Analysis (Secondary - Use at Discretion):
   - VBP bars appear as horizontal bars on the LEFT SIDE of the price chart, extending into the chart area
   - **CURRENT PRICE POSITION (RIGHT NOW) - MOST IMPORTANT:**
     * Price ABOVE big VBP bars RIGHT NOW = Strong support below, bullish for next few hours
     * Price BELOW big VBP bars RIGHT NOW = Strong resistance above, bearish for next few hours
     * Price IN low-volume zone RIGHT NOW = Easy movement potential (can go either direction quickly)
     * Price approaching big VBP bar (within 1-2%) = Likely to encounter support/resistance SOON
   - **IMMEDIATE SUPPORT/RESISTANCE:**
     * BIG BARS near current price = Strong support/resistance that will affect next few hours
     * Thick VBP bars directly above current price = Resistance level to watch
     * Thick VBP bars directly below current price = Support level to watch
   - **FREE FLOW ZONES (IMMEDIATE MOVEMENT):**
     * NARROW BARS or NO BARS near current price = Price can move quickly in either direction
     * Gaps between VBP bars near current price = Minimal resistance, fast movement potential
   - Lower priority for short-term: Historical VBP distribution patterns (less relevant for hours timeframe)
   - Use VBP only to identify support/resistance levels, not as primary determinant

8. Overall Momentum & Convergence (Primary Indicators First):
   - **PRIMARY INDICATOR ALIGNMENT (REQUIRED):**
     * Look for symbols where the THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS (Hurst, MESA, CCO) align in the same direction
     * ALL THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS must align bullishly for a strong bullish signal
     * If primary indicators conflict, the symbol is NOT a strong setup
   - **SECONDARY INDICATOR CONFIRMATION (OPTIONAL):**
     * Secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) can provide additional confirmation
     * If secondary indicators align with primary indicators, signal is stronger
     * If secondary indicators conflict with primary indicators, rely on PRIMARY indicators
   - **CONVERGENCE:**
     * Strong confirmation across ALL THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS = Best setup
     * Early-stage patterns (not over-extended) are preferred
   - **TIMING:**
     * Focus on signals that are happening NOW or just happened (last 1-5 bars)
     * Ignore patterns that are developing over longer timeframes
   - **ENTRY TIMING:**
     * Best entries: Multiple indicators just aligned or crossing NOW
     * Avoid entries: Indicators showing divergence or overbought/oversold extremes

OUTPUT FORMAT:

CRITICAL WORKFLOW: Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip ahead or analyze symbols that don't pass the filter.

STEP 1: QUICK SCREENING - Review ALL symbols present in the provided charts/images. For each symbol, quickly check:

BULLISH SIGNALS (must have these PRIMARY indicators to pass filter):
- Hurst Composite: Above zero = BULLISH momentum (or trending upward)
- CCO: Fast Osc > Slow Osc = BULLISH (or Fast Osc crossing above Slow Osc)
- MESA Stochastic: Lines above triggers AND trending up = BULLISH (or bullish crossovers in top half)

BEARISH SIGNALS (these PRIMARY indicators mean SKIP the symbol):
- Hurst Composite: Below zero = BEARISH momentum (or trending downward, SKIP)
- CCO: Fast Osc < Slow Osc = BEARISH (SKIP)
- MESA Stochastic: Lines below triggers AND trending down = BEARISH (or bearish crossunders in bottom half, SKIP)

CRITICAL: A symbol must have AT LEAST 2 of the 3 PRIMARY indicators showing bullish signals to pass the filter. If 2 or more PRIMARY indicators are bearish, SKIP the symbol regardless of secondary indicators.

CRITICAL: Oversold conditions (low MESA values, low CCO values) do NOT make a bearish setup bullish. If Hurst is bearish AND CCO is bearish, it's BEARISH regardless of oversold conditions. SKIP IT.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- DO NOT confuse "oversold" with "bullish setup" - oversold means price is low, but if PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, CCO, MESA) are bearish, it's still a bearish setup
- DO NOT analyze symbols where PRIMARY indicators conflict or show bearish signals - rely on PRIMARY indicators first
- DO NOT analyze symbols where Fast Osc < Slow Osc - this is bearish CCO, not bullish
- DO NOT use secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) to override PRIMARY indicators - PRIMARY indicators determine bullish/bearish
- DO NOT say "about to cross" or "potential reversal" - only analyze symbols that ALREADY show bullish signals in PRIMARY indicators
- DO NOT fill the top 3 with bearish symbols just because they're "oversold" or "might reverse"

STEP 2: FILTER - After quick screening, identify ONLY symbols that show STRONG BULLISH signals in PRIMARY indicators. 
- Symbols with bearish Hurst Composite (below zero or trending down) = SKIP (DO NOT ANALYZE - this is bearish)
- Symbols with bearish CCO (Fast Osc < Slow Osc) = SKIP (DO NOT ANALYZE - this is bearish, not bullish)
- Symbols with bearish MESA crossunders = SKIP (DO NOT ANALYZE - these are bearish, not bullish)
- Symbols with overall bearish momentum in PRIMARY indicators = SKIP (DO NOT ANALYZE - these are bearish, not bullish)
- CRITICAL: Oversold conditions (low MESA values, low CCO values) do NOT make a bearish setup bullish. If Hurst is bearish AND CCO is bearish, it's STILL BEARISH even if oversold. SKIP IT.
- CRITICAL: A symbol must have AT LEAST 2 of these 3 PRIMARY indicators showing bullish signals to be considered bullish:
  * Bullish Hurst Composite (above zero or trending upward)
  * Bullish CCO (Fast Osc > Slow Osc) OR Fast Osc crossing above Slow Osc
  * Bullish MESA (lines above triggers, trending up, or bullish crossovers in top half)
- Secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) can provide confirmation but do NOT override PRIMARY indicators
- Only proceed to detailed analysis for symbols that pass this PRIMARY indicator bullish filter

STEP 3: DETAILED ANALYSIS - Only provide complete analysis for symbols that passed the bullish filter in STEP 2. 

CRITICAL DECISION POINT:
- FIRST: Count how many symbols passed the bullish filter in STEP 2
- IF ZERO symbols passed the filter: State "No strong bullish setups found. All analyzed symbols show weak, mixed, or bearish signals." and STOP IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT provide any detailed analysis for any symbols
- IF 1-2 symbols passed the filter: Provide complete analysis ONLY for those symbols that passed
- IF 3+ symbols passed the filter: Provide complete analysis for the TOP 3 BEST symbols that passed

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT provide detailed analysis for symbols that are bearish, neutral, or should be avoided
- Do NOT analyze symbols that failed the filter in STEP 2
- Do NOT analyze symbols "just to fill the top 3" - if only 1 symbol passed, analyze only that 1 symbol
- If you find yourself analyzing a symbol with inverted EMAs or bearish CCO, STOP - you made an error in STEP 2

CRITICAL REMINDER BEFORE STARTING DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. FIRST: Check how many symbols passed the bullish filter in STEP 2
2. IF ZERO symbols passed: State "No strong bullish setups found" and STOP - do NOT analyze any symbols
3. IF symbols passed: Only analyze those symbols that passed the filter
4. Do NOT analyze symbols that failed the filter - skip them entirely
5. Do NOT analyze bearish symbols just to fill the top 3

For each symbol that passed the bullish filter (ONLY symbols that passed STEP 2), provide complete analysis:

Symbol: [SYMBOL]

PRIMARY INDICATORS (Required Analysis):

Hurst Spectral Analysis Oscillator (PRIMARY):
- EMA 10: $X.XX, EMA 30: $X.XX, EMA 100: $X.XX
- Relationship: EMA 10 [above/below] EMA 30 [above/below] EMA 100
- CRITICAL CHECK: If EMA 10 < EMA 30 < EMA 100, this is BEARISH (inverted EMAs). This symbol should NOT have passed the filter. If you're analyzing a symbol with inverted EMAs, STOP - this is an error.
- EMA Stage: [Convergence/Recent Crosses/Butterfly/Spread-Expansion]
- Recent Crosses: [Note any recent crosses of shorter-term EMAs over longer-term EMAs - this is a positive signal]
- Butterfly Pattern: [Yes/No - only Yes if EMA 10 > EMA 30 > EMA 100 - all three EMAs in ascending order]
- Assessment: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish signal strength based on composite direction and period alignment]

MESA Stochastic Multi Length (PRIMARY):
- [Recent trend direction, momentum strength, pattern formations]

Volume Analysis (Equal Weight):
- [Volume trends, spikes, support for price movement]

Hurst Analysis (Equal Weight):
- [Composite oscillator direction, period-specific signals, alignment]

MESA Stochastic (Equal Weight):
- MESA1: [Current value, position relative to trigger, trend direction]
- MESA2: [Current value, position relative to trigger, trend direction]
- MESA3: [Current value, position relative to trigger, trend direction]

Cycle Channel Oscillator - CCO (PRIMARY):
- Fast Osc: [Current value, position in channel (0.0-1.0), trend direction]
- Slow Osc: [Current value, position in channel (0.0-1.0), trend direction]
- Relationship: [Fast Osc ABOVE Slow Osc = BULLISH, Fast Osc BELOW Slow Osc = BEARISH]
- CRITICAL CHECK: If Fast Osc < Slow Osc, this is BEARISH CCO. This symbol should NOT have passed the filter. If you're analyzing a symbol with Fast Osc < Slow Osc, STOP - this is an error. Do NOT say "about to cross" - only analyze symbols where Fast Osc > Slow Osc RIGHT NOW.
- Trend: [Both oscillators trending upward = bullish, both trending downward = bearish]
- Extreme Conditions: [Any values above 1.0 (overbought) or below 0.0 (oversold) - highlighted in purple]
- Assessment: [Bullish/Neutral/Bearish signal strength based on oscillator positions and relationship - if Fast Osc < Slow Osc, this MUST be Bearish, not Bullish]

SECONDARY INDICATORS (Use at Discretion - For Confirmation Only):

EMA Analysis (Secondary - Use at Discretion):
- VBP Bar Distribution: [Describe the pattern - clustered big bars, scattered bars, gaps, etc.]

- [PRIMARY Indicator Alignment: How many PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, MESA, CCO) align bullishly? ALL THREE must align bullishly for strongest signal. At least 2 of 3 must be bullish to pass filter]
- [Signal Strength: Count how many PRIMARY indicators show bullish signals. For a symbol to be ranked, at least 2 of 3 PRIMARY indicators must show bullish signals]
- [Secondary Indicator Confirmation: Do secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) confirm the PRIMARY indicator direction? This provides additional confidence but does NOT override PRIMARY indicators]
- [Conflicts: Note any conflicts between PRIMARY indicators - if PRIMARY indicators conflict, this is NOT a strong setup. If secondary indicators conflict with PRIMARY indicators, rely on PRIMARY indicators]
- [Recent signals (last 1-5 bars): What signals just happened that indicate immediate movement?]
- [Convergence: Do multiple indicators confirm the same direction?]
- [Entry timing: Is this a good time to enter NOW based on indicator alignment, or wait for better convergence?]
- [CRITICAL CHECK: Before proceeding, verify this Overall Assessment confirms STRONG BULLISH direction. If it says "bearish", "neutral", "AVOID", "Strong Sell", "Weakly Bearish", "Not a bullish setup", or any negative language, this symbol MUST be excluded from analysis and ranking]

FINAL RANKING SECTION - ONLY PROVIDE THIS IF YOU ANALYZED SYMBOLS IN STEP 3:

CRITICAL: Only provide Final Ranking if you actually analyzed symbols in STEP 3. If you stated "No strong bullish setups found" and did not analyze any symbols, skip this entire Final Ranking section.

CRITICAL: Before creating the Final Ranking, verify that each symbol's "Overall Assessment" explicitly states BULLISH direction. If any symbol's Overall Assessment says "bearish", "neutral", "AVOID", "Strong Sell", "Weakly Bearish", "Not a bullish setup", or any negative language, DO NOT include it in the ranking.

Final Ranking (Ranked by PRIMARY Indicator Bullish Signal Strength - ONLY include STRONG BULLISH symbols):
1. [Top symbol] - LONG - [Brief reason focusing on PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, MESA, CCO) - how many PRIMARY indicators align bullishly]
2. [Second symbol] - LONG - [Brief reason focusing on PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, MESA, CCO) - how many PRIMARY indicators align bullishly]
3. [Third symbol] - LONG - [Brief reason focusing on PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, MESA, CCO) - how many PRIMARY indicators align bullishly]

NOTE: Only include STRONG BULLISH (LONG) setups where PRIMARY indicators (Hurst, MESA, CCO) align positively. Rank by PRIMARY indicator bullish signal strength. Secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) can provide confirmation but PRIMARY indicators determine ranking. If fewer than 3 symbols qualify, only rank those that qualify. If no symbols qualify, state "No strong bullish setups found." 

CRITICAL RANKING RULES:
- If fewer than 3 symbols show STRONG bullish signals in PRIMARY indicators, only rank those that are STRONGLY bullish
- If NO symbols show strong bullish signals in PRIMARY indicators, state: "No strong bullish setups found. All analyzed symbols show weak, mixed, or bearish signals in PRIMARY indicators." and STOP - do NOT provide any ranking
- Do NOT include symbols with weak, mixed, or bearish PRIMARY indicators just to fill the ranking
- Do NOT rank symbols where PRIMARY indicators conflict or show bearish signals
- A symbol must have STRONG alignment across PRIMARY indicators (at least 2 of 3 bullish) to be ranked
- The more PRIMARY indicators that align bullishly, the stronger the signal
- Secondary indicators (EMAs, Volume, VBP) can provide confirmation but do NOT override PRIMARY indicators

IMPORTANT: Only rank symbols that show STRONG BULLISH signals with clear alignment across multiple indicators. Weak or mixed signals should NOT be ranked. If a symbol's Overall Assessment says "AVOID", "bearish", "do not enter", or similar negative language, it should NOT be ranked.

CRITICAL: Before ranking, check each symbol's Overall Assessment. If it says the symbol is bearish, neutral, or should be avoided, DO NOT include it in the ranking. Only rank symbols where the Overall Assessment confirms bullish direction.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT OUTPUT WHEN NO SYMBOLS PASS FILTER:
"After reviewing all symbols in STEP 1 and applying the bullish filter in STEP 2, no symbols showed strong bullish signals. All symbols had bearish EMAs (inverted), bearish CCO (Fast Osc < Slow Osc), or other bearish indicators. 

No strong bullish setups found. All analyzed symbols show weak, mixed, or bearish signals."

[STOP HERE - Do NOT analyze any symbols, do NOT provide Final Ranking]
